### For comprehensive analysis: 

- "Analyze all my notes, projects, and pages to identify the top 10 recurring themes, patterns, and concepts I keep returning to. Group them by category (personal development, business, health, etc.) and explain how they connect to each other."
- "Review my entire workspace and create a detailed report on: 1) My core interests and obsessions, 2) Recurring problems I'm trying to solve, 3) Key principles that guide my work, 4) Patterns in my learning and project choices, and 5) Areas where I invest the most time and energy."

### For actionable insights:

- "Based on everything I've documented, what are the 5-7 central themes that define my work and interests? For each theme, identify: the specific concepts I explore, how they relate to my goals, and what this reveals about my priorities and values."
- "Create a 'Personal Operating System' summary by identifying: my recurring interests and obsessions, the principles I live by, my preferred learning methods, common challenges I face, and the tools/systems I consistently return to. Show how these elements work together."

### For pattern recognition:

- "Map out the connections between my different projects, interests, and notes. What underlying patterns emerge? What does this tell me about my natural tendencies, strengths, and the direction I'm heading?"
